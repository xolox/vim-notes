*notes.txt*  Easy note taking in Vim

The notes.vim plug-in for the Vim text editor makes it easy to manage your
notes in Vim:

 - Starting a new note: Execute the ':Note' command to create a new buffer and
   load the appropriate file type and syntax

 - You can also start a new note with the selected text as title using the
   ':NoteFromSelectedText' command

 - Saving notes: Just use Vim's |:write| and |:update| commands, you don't need to
   provide a filename because it will be set based on the title (first line)
   of your note (you also don't need to worry about special characters,
   they'll be escaped)

 - Editing existing notes: Execute ':Note anything' to edit a note containing
   'anything' in its title (if no notes are found a new one is created with
   its title set to 'anything')

 - Deleting notes: The ':DeleteNote' command enables you to delete the current
   note

 - Searching notes: ':SearchNotes keyword …' searches for keywords and
   ':SearchNotes /pattern/' searches for regular expressions

 - Smart defaults: Without an argument ':SearchNotes' searches for the word
   under the cursor (if the word starts with '@' that character will be
   included in the search, this means you can easily search for @tagged notes)

 - Back-references: The ':RelatedNotes' command find all notes referencing the
   current file

 - A Python 2 [1] script is included that accelerates keyword searches using an
   SQLite [2] database

 - The ':RecentNotes' command lists your notes by modification date, starting
   with the most recently edited note

 - Navigating between notes: The included file type plug-in redefines |gf| to
   jump between notes and the syntax script highlights note names as hyper
   links

 - Writing aids: The included file type plug-in contains mappings for automatic
   curly quotes, arrows and list bullets and supports completion of note
   titles using Control-X Control-U

 - Embedded file types: The included syntax script supports embedded
   highlighting using blocks marked with '{{{type … }}}' which allows you to
   embed highlighted code and configuration snippets in your notes

Here's a screen shot of the syntax mode using the slate [3] color scheme:

Install & usage ~

Unzip the most recent ZIP archive [5] file inside your Vim profile directory
(usually this is '~/.vim' on UNIX and '%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles' on Windows),
restart Vim and execute the command ':helptags ~/.vim/doc' (use ':helptags
~\vimfiles\doc' instead on Windows). To get started execute ':Note' or ':edit
note:', this will start a new note that contains instructions on how to
continue from there (and how to use the plug-in in general).

                                                                 *notes-options*
Options ~

These options can be configured in your ~/.vimrc by including a line like this:

    let g:notes_suffix = ".txt"

All of the options are defined in `plugin/notes.vim`, but the ones you will
most likely want to modify are:

                                               *g:notes_directory*
    |g:notes_directory|                         string (default <plugin>/user)

      The location where notes are saved.

                                               *g:notes_suffix*
  |g:notes_suffix|                              string (default blank)

      The suffix to add to all generated filename. The filename is determined
      based on the note's title, and by default the filename will not have an
      extension. You can add any suffix or extension to the filenames with this
      options (e.g. .txt), which will not be reflected in the note's title.
