If you're looking for the simplest way to get the plug-in up and running, download [the latest ZIP archive](http://peterodding.com/code/vim/downloads/notes.zip) from [Vim Online](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3375), unzip that in `~/.vim/` (on UNIX) or `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` (on Windows) and you're good to go.

If you're using git and/or [Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) and want to keep the plug-in up to date using git, you can use the GitHub repository directly, just make sure to use `git clone --recursive` when you clone the repository so that the submodule with autoload scripts is included (the plug-in will give you a hint if you forget this).
